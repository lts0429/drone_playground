# Introduction
This project explores methods and solutions for navigating drones beneath forest canopies, where GPS signals are weak and visibility is limited. The goal is to research and prototype approaches that enable drones to move safely and efficiently in complex, cluttered environmentsâ€”unlocking applications in forestry, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and search & rescue.

- [x] setup gazebo environment
- [x] spawn drone
- [x] add 3d lidar
- [x] setup EKF for localization
- [x] setup Nav2
- [x] implement orb slam3 (stereo)

# Todos
- [] extract orb slam3 odometry
